# Hermes

UNDER DEVELOPMENT!

## Introduction

This is a distributed configuration server made in PHP, using Zend Expressive micro-framework.

It's goal is to provide configuration via REST API to distributed systems, like in a micro service architeture.

 You can fetch the configurations directly or using one of the client libraries.
 
 The client library is [Hermes-Client](https://github.com/mt-olympus/hermes-client) and there will be framework-specific implmentations in the future.
