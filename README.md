## Introduction

This is a distributed configuration server made in PHP, using Zend Expressive micro-framework.

It's goal is to provide configuration via REST API to distributed systems, like in a micro service architeture.

 You can fetch the configurations directly or using one of the client libraries.
 
 You can use [Hermes](https://github.com/mt-olympus/hermes) as client, or directly via REST calls.
